# CMS
PHP CMS - second version of the CMS project built as part of my course at Eastleigh College.

This CMS project was built as part of my Eastleigh College. The focus of the project was on the server side of creating websites. 
The CMS users a mix of POST and GET requests to deal with the handling of the data. The most fully featured aspect is the admin section which is not possible to access without being logged in, as admin's have CRUD access to all posts, users and categories. 

The website was created using a modified Bootstrap templates and then enhanced with PHP. 

The current version of the website is live here:

Some elements are still place holders as the final version is not expected to relate to programming languages. The majority of the content is pulled from the database rather than hard coded.
